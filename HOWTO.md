# Using EthVPN

EthVPN is a marketplace where Shadowsocks servers (proxies) are matched with shadowsocks clients (you).

As a client, you must:

## 1. Get some of the digital currency "ether".

Ether is the digital currency through which you'll make payments.  You can get ether from [coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/52fbe721d358f6dda000010a).  If you use our link you'll get some free money to pay your first proxy!  Even if you don't use the proxy much, hold onto that ether, I hear it's [going up](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)!

## 2. Install a Shadowsocks client for your platform
First, install the ShadowSocks client.  A list of clients is [here](https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.html). 
If you use iOS, we personally like [Waterdrop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waterdrop-shadowsocks-client-for-ios/id1212107997?mt=8).

## 3. Choose your proxy
Now you access Ethereum.

## 4. Pay your chosen proxy
Here is where you pay in Ether.

## 5. Connect to your chosen proxy
This is where you set your local proxy settings.
